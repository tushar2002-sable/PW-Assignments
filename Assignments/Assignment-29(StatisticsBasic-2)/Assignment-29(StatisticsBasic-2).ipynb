    "- `Covariance:` The magnitude of covariance does not provide a clear indication of the strength of the relationship. It only shows whether the variables move together (positive covariance) or in opposite directions (negative covariance).\n",
    "- `Correlation:` The magnitude of the correlation coefficient directly indicates the strength of the linear relationship between the variables. Values closer to +1 or -1 indicate stronger relationships, while values closer to 0 indicate a weaker or no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "`4. Standardization:`\n",
    "- `Covariance:` Covariance is not standardized, so its magnitude is affected by the scale of the variables. This makes comparing covariances across datasets with different units challenging.\n",
    "- `Correlation:` Correlation is standardized, making it unitless. It can be used to compare relationships between variables with different scales."

    "Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data in a dataset. These extreme values can have a substantial impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion. Let's explore how outliers affect these measures using an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "`1. Mean:`\n",
    "The mean is sensitive to outliers because it considers all data points. When an outlier is present, it can significantly pull the mean towards itself. In the first dataset, the mean was around 175.36, but after adding the outlier 230, the mean increased to 184.83. The outlier has a substantial impact on the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "`2. Median:`\n",
    "The median is less affected by outliers since it only considers the middle value(s) and is not influenced by extreme values. In the first dataset, the median was 175, and after adding the outlier, it changed to 175.5. The change is relatively small compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "`3. Standard Deviation:`\n",
    "The standard deviation is also sensitive to outliers because it takes into account the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Outliers that are far from the mean can increase the dispersion and cause the standard deviation to increase. In the first dataset, the standard deviation was around 9.29, and after adding the outlier, it increased to 22.91."
