    "1. **Identify the features in the dataset.** The first step is to identify the features in the dataset. This can be done by looking at the data dictionary or by exploring the data using a data visualization tool.\n",
    "2. **Choose a statistical measure for feature selection.** There are a number of different statistical measures that can be used for feature selection. Some common measures include the p-value, the correlation coefficient, and the information gain. The p-value is a measure of the statistical significance of a feature. Features with a low p-value are more likely to be important. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two features. Features with a high correlation coefficient are likely to be related. The information gain is a measure of how much information a feature provides about the target variable. Features with a high information gain are more likely to be important.\n",
    "3. **Calculate the statistical measure for each feature.** Once you have chosen a statistical measure, you need to calculate the statistical measure for each feature. This can be done using a statistical software package or a data science library. For example, if you are using the p-value to select features, you would need to calculate the p-value for each feature.\n",
    "4. **Select the features with the highest statistical measure.** The final step is to select the features with the highest statistical measure. The features with the highest statistical measure are the most likely to be important for the customer churn prediction model. For example, if you are using the p-value to select features, you would select the features with the lowest p-values."

The process continues until the desired number of features is reached.\n",
