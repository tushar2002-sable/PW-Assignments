    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. It works by creating a tree-like structure of decisions, where each decision node represents a feature of the data, and each branch represents a possible value for that feature. The leaf nodes of the tree represent the predicted outcome for the data.\n",
