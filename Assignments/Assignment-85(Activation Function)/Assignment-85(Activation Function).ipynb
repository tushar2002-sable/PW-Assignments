    "The rectified linear unit (ReLU) function is a simple non-linear function that outputs the input if it is positive, and 0 otherwise. It is a popular choice for activation functions in neural networks because it is fast and easy to compute.\n",

Without activation functions, neural networks would simply be linear regression models, which are only capable of learning linear relationships.\n",
    "* **Gradient flow:** Activation functions also affect the gradient flow through a neural network. The gradient flow is a measure of how the error of the network changes as the weights of the network are adjusted. A good activation function will allow gradients to flow easily through the network, which can help the network to train more quickly and efficiently.\n",

This is a problem where the gradients become very small as they are propagated through the network, which can make it difficult for the network to train. Other activation functions, such as the ReLU and leaky ReLU functions, are less susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

The expressive power of a neural network is its ability to learn a variety of different functions. Some activation functions, such as the sigmoid and tanh functions, have limited expressive power.
