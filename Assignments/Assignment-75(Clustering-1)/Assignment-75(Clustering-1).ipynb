    "* **Centroid-based clustering algorithms:** These algorithms group data points based on their proximity to a central point, or centroid. The most common centroid-based clustering algorithm is K-Means clustering. K-Means clustering works by partitioning the data into a predefined number of clusters, where each cluster is represented by a centroid. The algorithm then assigns each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid.\n",
    "* **Hierarchical clustering algorithms:** These algorithms create a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster is either a subcluster of another cluster or a parent cluster of other clusters. The two most common hierarchical clustering algorithms are agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point in its own cluster and then merges the two closest clusters until a predefined number of clusters remain. Divisive clustering starts with all of the data points in one cluster and then splits the cluster into two smaller clusters until a predefined number of clusters remain.\n",
    "* **Density-based clustering algorithms:** These algorithms group data points based on their density. The most common density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). DBSCAN works by identifying dense regions of data points, or cores, and then assigning all of the data points within a certain distance of a core to the same cluster.\n",
    "* **Distribution-based clustering algorithms:** These algorithms group data points based on their distribution. The most common distribution-based clustering algorithm is Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). GMMs work by fitting a mixture of Gaussian distributions to the data and then assigning each data point to the cluster with the most likely Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "* **Centroid-based clustering algorithms:** Centroid-based clustering algorithms assume that the data is clustered around a small number of well-defined centroids. These algorithms are efficient and easy to implement, but they can be sensitive to outliers and the initial choice of centroids.\n",
    "* **Hierarchical clustering algorithms:** Hierarchical clustering algorithms do not make any assumptions about the shape or distribution of the clusters. These algorithms are able to discover complex cluster structures, but they can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "* **Density-based clustering algorithms:** Density-based clustering algorithms assume that the data is clustered into regions of high density, separated by regions of low density. These algorithms are robust to outliers and can discover clusters of arbitrary shape. However, they can be sensitive to the choice of density parameters.\n",

These algorithms are able to discover complex cluster structures, but they can be sensitive to the choice of probability distributions."

The clustering solution with the highest silhouette score is often considered to be the optimal solution.\n",
