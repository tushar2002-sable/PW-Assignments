    "   Descriptive statistics involves organizing, summarizing, and describing data using measures such as central tendency (mean, median, mode), variability (range, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, bar charts). It aims to provide a clear and concise summary of the data.\n",

Here's an example to illustrate the importance:\n",

If we treat the level of education as a numerical variable and perform arithmetic operations such as calculating the mean or performing regression analysis, it would be an incorrect interpretation of the data. The nominal level of education does not possess the same mathematical properties as ratio-level data, and applying numerical operations to it would not make sense.\n",

For example, when analyzing the relationship between education level and income, we can use a contingency table or chi-square test for nominal data to examine the association between the two variables. Additionally, for income (ratio data), we can calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, or perform regression analysis to explore the relationship with other variables.\n",

    "   How it describes a dataset: The mean provides a measure of the central value around which the data points tend to cluster. It is sensitive to extreme values and reflects the overall distribution of the dataset.\n",

    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data.\n",
