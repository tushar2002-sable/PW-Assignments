Bagging is a process of creating multiple copies of the training data and training a decision tree on each copy. The predictions of the individual decision trees are then averaged to produce the final prediction.\n",

    "Bagging helps to reduce overfitting by making the decision trees less sensitive to noise in the training data. This is because each decision tree is trained on a different copy of the data, and the noise in the data is likely to affect different trees to different degrees. By averaging the predictions of the individual decision trees, the noise is averaged out.\n",

This is because the individual decision trees are trained on different copies of the data, and they are also likely to use different features to make their predictions.
