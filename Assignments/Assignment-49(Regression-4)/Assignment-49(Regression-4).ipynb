    "Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty to the model's coefficients. This penalty encourages the coefficients to be small, which can help to prevent overfitting and to identify the most important features.\n",

    "Lasso regression differs from other regression techniques in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The penalty:** Lasso regression uses a penalty that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This means that the penalty is larger for coefficients that are larger in magnitude. This encourages some of the coefficients to be zero, which can help to reduce the model's complexity and to improve its interpretability.\n",
    "2. **The goal:** The goal of lasso regression is to minimize the sum of the squared errors and the penalty term. This is different from the goal of ordinary least squares regression, which is to minimize the sum of the squared errors only.\n",

    "1. **Polynomial features:** One way to use lasso regression for non-linear regression problems is to create polynomial features. Polynomial features are created by taking the original features and raising them to different powers. For example, if we have a feature called \"x\", we could create three polynomial features: x, x^2, and x^3.\n",
    "2. **Non-linear transformations:** Another way to use lasso regression for non-linear regression problems is to apply non-linear transformations to the features. Non-linear transformations are functions that map the features to a new space. For example, we could apply the logarithm transformation to the features.\n",
    "3. **Ensemble methods:** Ensemble methods are methods that combine multiple models to improve performance.
