    "Grid search CV is a machine learning technique that is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are the settings that control the model's behavior, such as the learning rate, the number of trees in a random forest, or the regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. For each combination of hyperparameter values, the model is trained on a training set and evaluated on a validation set. The hyperparameter combination that produces the best performance on the validation set is selected as the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV can be a computationally expensive process, especially if the model is complex or the grid of hyperparameter values is large. However, it is a reliable way to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model.\n",

    "* **It can help to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model:** Grid search CV can help to find the hyperparameters that produce the best performance on a given data set.\n",
