    "There are several ways to choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for elastic net regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation is a popular method for choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters. In cross-validation, the data is divided into two or more folds. The model is trained on one fold and then evaluated on the other folds. This process is repeated for each fold, and the values of the regularization parameters that result in the best performance are chosen.\n",
    "2. **AIC and BIC:** AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion) are two statistical criteria that can be used to choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters. AIC and BIC penalize the model complexity, and they can be used to find the model that minimizes the error while also being parsimonious.\n",
    "3. **Regularization path:** The regularization path is a plot of the coefficients of the model as a function of the regularization parameters. The optimal values of the regularization parameters can be found by looking for the point on the regularization path where the coefficients start to shrink towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters depends on the specific data set and the goals of the analysis. Cross-validation is a generally reliable method for choosing the regularization parameters, but it can be computationally expensive. AIC and BIC are simpler to compute than cross-validation, but they may not always be as accurate. The regularization path can be used to get a visual understanding of how the model changes as the regularization parameters change, but it can be difficult to interpret."
