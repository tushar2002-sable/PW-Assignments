    "In machine learning, an ensemble technique is a method that combines multiple models to improve the performance of the overall system. Ensemble techniques are often used to reduce the variance of the predictions made by a single model.\n",

    "There are many different ensemble techniques, but some of the most common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bagging:** Bagging is a technique that creates multiple copies of a base model and trains each copy on a different subset of the training data. The predictions of the individual models are then averaged to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "* **Boosting:** Boosting is a technique that creates a sequence of models, each of which is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models. The predictions of the individual models are then weighted and combined to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "* **Random forests:** Random forests are a type of ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the training data, and the predictions of the individual trees are then averaged to produce the final prediction.\n",

This is because the different models may be affected by noise and outliers to different degrees, and by averaging the predictions, the ensemble can reduce the impact of these factors.\n",
    "* **To improve interpretability:** Ensemble techniques can also be used to improve the interpretability of models.
