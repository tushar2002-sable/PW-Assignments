    "It is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, resulting in a system deadlock. This can happen when there is a circular dependency between the resources that threads are trying to acquire, and none of them can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads: Thread A and Thread B. Thread A holds resource X and needs resource Y, while Thread B holds resource Y and needs resource X. If both threads try to acquire the resources at the same time, a deadlock occurs because neither thread can proceed without the resource held by the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Race Condition:`\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. It arises when multiple threads or processes access shared data or resources without proper synchronization, and the final outcome depends on the order of execution. Race conditions can lead to incorrect results, data corruption, or unexpected program behavior. They can be difficult to debug and reproduce since they may occur sporadically depending on the timing and execution environment."
